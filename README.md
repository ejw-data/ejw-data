I'm **`Erin Wills`**.  I have a background in Chemical Engineering but my early career was about developing logic on a highly proprietary system and transferring that software to a client's system.  In recent years, I have been interested in using more open source tools that are transferable among many industries and are always expanding and evolving.  

For detailed information about me, please visit my github website:  [https://ejw-data.github.io/](https://ejw-data.github.io/)
